## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Hero Section Problems**
- Dark teal/blue background makes text hard to read

- Missing engaging imagery or visual interest

### 2. **Typography Issues**

- Color contrast issues throughout

### 3. **Spacing & Layout**
- Sections feel cramped together
- Not enough whitespace/breathing room
- Cards and elements too close to each other

- No warmth or approachability

### 5. **Component Design**
- Icons are generic and lack personality
